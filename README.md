# ALPHA-shop
ALPHA-shop is the first React project I built, using JSX syntax and follows the React coding style to create reusable UI components. 

## Feature
User is able to fill out step by step forms to checkout products, and depends on the user's preference, can choose either dark mode or light mode to adjust lighting.

## Install the project
1. Ensure already installed `node.js`
2. Clone the project
3. Enter the project folder `cd alpha-shop`. And install npm `npm install`
4. Start the project `npm start`
5. To exit, press `ctl + c`
